 * Expressions are simple computation components.

 * change their state and it is not guaranteed, in which order they get called.
 * If the expression has been called before, the last computed value will be
 * available from the datarow.
 *
 * This construct allows us to write expressions in the form
 * "Sum := Sum + Column".
 *
 * Multiple calls to getValue on the same expression instance must return the
 * same value (assuming that the datarow passed in is the same).
